## General info
In this directory, we present descriptive analysis and the code to perform a Bayesian hierarchical modeling to estimate under reported cases of leprosy in Brazil.

The code originated from the results described in [1]. This was an interdisciplinary work aimed to apply mathematical/statistical tools to better understand the dissemination of leprosy in Brazil. 

## Compilation
We performed our descriptive analysis using Python version 3.6.5.  Our model was implemented using NIMBLE in conjunction with the software R [2], following the supplementary materials provided in [3].
